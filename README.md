# Email Validator

It verifies weather an email is:
  - Valid?
  - Deliverable?
  - Autocomplete common email extentions
  - and some other features, you can see from the pictures below

#### I've used the following technologies:
  1. react 16.3.6
  2. typescript 2.8.1
  3. Kickboxing API to verify emails
  4. Regular expressions for client side validations
  5. Webpack 4.5.0
  6. and a bunch of loaders where you can visit package.json file and see them
